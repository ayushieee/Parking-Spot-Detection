PARKING SPOT DETECTION


Introduction:
The Parking Space Occupancy Analysis System is an automated solution for analyzing parking space occupancy in real-time video feeds. The system utilizes advanced image processing techniques and a Siamese Neural Network to accurately detect and classify parking spaces, providing real-time information on parking space availability. This project aims to improve parking management efficiency, reduce congestion, and enhance the overall urban mobility experience.

Problem Statement:
Inefficient parking management in urban areas leads to congestion, pollution, and driver frustration. Traditional methods of monitoring parking spaces are labor-intensive and error-prone. There is a need for an automated system that can accurately and efficiently analyze parking space occupancy to optimize parking resource utilization.

Solution Overview:
The Parking Space Occupancy Analysis System offers a solution to the aforementioned problem by providing a real-time analysis of parking space occupancy. The system utilizes a Siamese Neural Network for occupancy detection, which has been trained on pairs of images (occupied and unoccupied spaces) to predict occupancy status. This approach allows for accurate and efficient analysis of parking space occupancy, even in challenging lighting conditions and diverse parking layouts.

Technical Details:

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and Matplotlib.
Image Processing Techniques: Frame extraction, resizing, noise reduction with Gaussian blur, and adaptive thresholding.
Siamese Neural Network: Trained on pairs of images for occupancy detection.
Morphological Operations: Used for refining contours and improving accuracy.
Implementation:
The system is implemented in Python, with OpenCV used for image processing and TensorFlow/Keras for the Siamese Neural Network. The system extracts frames from video feeds, preprocesses them using various techniques, detects parking spaces, and predicts occupancy status using the trained neural network. The system provides real-time information on parking space availability, which can be displayed to users through a user interface.
